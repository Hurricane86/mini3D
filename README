Welcome to mini3D!

Mini3D is an easy to use, cross platform, wrapper for DirectX and OpenGL.
It aims to give the easiest possible API for drawing 3D graphics without
sacrificing (to much) performance or functionality. Mini3D supports only
the progammable shader pipline, removes redundant API calls, and hides 
as much as possible behind the scenes.

Mini3D can be used under the MIT License. Please see the LICENCE file in
the root folder of the code archive.

More information on how to use mini3D can be found at www.mini3d.org.

Best of luck using mini3D!
